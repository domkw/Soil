# Atterberg Limits
The Atterberg Limits of soils are assessed through a sequence of laboratory tests aimed at categorizing the characteristics of silt and clay soils at various moisture levels. Geotechnical engineers rely on Atterberg limits to design foundations for structures and anticipate the performance of soils in applications such as fills, embankments, and pavements.



## Test number  ASTM 

ASTM D4318-00 -  **Standard Test Methods for Liquid Limit, Plastic Limit, and Plasticity Index of Soils**.
