# Atterberg Limits
The Atterberg Limits of soils are assessed through a sequence of laboratory tests aimed at categorizing the characteristics of silt and clay soils at various moisture levels. Geotechnical engineers rely on Atterberg limits to design foundations for structures and anticipate the performance of soils in applications such as fills, embankments, and pavements.

## Unified Soil Classification System - USCS 
  
The Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) is a soil classification system used to categorize and describe different types of soils based on their engineering properties. It was developed by the United States Bureau of Reclamation and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The USCS classifies soils into three primary categories based on their grain size distribution and plasticity characteristics:

1.  Coarse-Grained Soils:
    
    -   Gravel (G): Consists of individual particles larger than 4.75 mm (No. 4 sieve size).
    -   Sand (S): Consists of individual particles ranging from 0.075 mm (No. 200 sieve size) to 4.75 mm (No. 4 sieve size).
2.  Fine-Grained Soils:
    
    -   Silt (M): Consists of individual particles ranging from 0.075 mm (No. 200 sieve size) to 0.002 mm (No. 200 mesh size).
    -   Clay (C): Consists of individual particles smaller than 0.002 mm (No. 200 mesh size).
3.  Organic Soils:
    
    -   Organic (O): Consists of soils with significant organic content, such as peat or muck.

Additionally, the USCS uses prefixes to indicate the soil's plasticity characteristics:

-   "L" denotes low plasticity.
-   "H" denotes high plasticity.
-   "P" denotes poorly graded.
-   "W" denotes well-graded.

The USCS classification for a soil type is typically represented by combining the primary category, plasticity prefix (if applicable), and additional modifiers (if needed).

For example, a well-graded sandy soil with high plasticity would be classified as "SP-SM" (Sandy Silt).

It's important to note that the USCS classification system provides a standardized way of categorizing soils based on their properties and behavior. It is widely used in geotechnical engineering and provides valuable information for engineering design and construction purposes.
